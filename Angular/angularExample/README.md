# AngularExample


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.2.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Authentication API

Login, register (`/register`) and password recovery (`/recover-password`) use the
`auth-example` backend (`/auth-example/api/users`). `ng serve` proxies
`/auth-example` to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (see `proxy.conf.json`), so the backend must be
running there. The profile is loaded from `GET /users/me` after login (falling back to the JWT claims). The JWT is kept in `localStorage` and sent as a bearer token on same-origin
requests. New accounts are registered with role `USER`.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
